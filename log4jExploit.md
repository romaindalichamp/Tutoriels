# Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities

## Official Security Advisory
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

## Find vulnerabilities

1. Check Direct Usage of librairies in the POM
2. Explore Jar Dependencies
   1. `for i in $(locate "/mnt/c/workspace/collector-topology/*.jar"); do echo "$i"; jar -tvf "$i" | grep -Hsi log4j; done`

## Fix it

* Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.
* Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in progress, expected to be available soon).
* Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
